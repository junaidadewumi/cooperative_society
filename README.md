A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT

This is a Cooperative Society Project coded in Python. In this project, we have three categories of members named: Members with contributions, members without contributions, and non- members known as loanee.

Three tables were created in the database: the member table, non-member table, and society treasure table. 

In this project, the members with contributions have an interest of 10% for making contributions. When taking on loan, the interest that will be added to the money refund shall be 2% of the money borrowed. 

Members without contribution. When taking on loan, the interest that will be added to the money refund shall be 5% of the money borrowed. 

Also, the non-members, when taking on loan, the interest shall be 15% of the money borrowed. 

Few rules were given to both members and non-members to take on loan. Nevertheless, all these categories of members were registered members or users.
